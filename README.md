## Details

- Inpuy your expenses and income. It will calculate your total balance and total expenses you input
- The data will be saved in your browser. When you reload the web, all of the data that been saved will be shown in the page immediately.
- Currency displayed is in IDR (Indonesian Rupiah)\*

<sup>(\*) You can change the currency and number formatting the same with your country, I commented pretty much everything in the code</sup>

## What I Learn

Handling the logic, saving inputted data to local storage and serve the data to page is quite tricky for me.<br>Updating UI when the page is loaded took hours for me to solve but in the end I managed to handle that even though I'm really sure mine is messy and there is more effective way to do it.
